# eng-black-books
Intended to be engineering black books migrating from MacOS notes.  Trying out mkdocs as a solution.  

## Prerequisites
* GIT
* Docker
* Visual Studioa Code IDE (to attach to container)

## Dev Enviornment Steps
1. Clone repo to dev machine.

2. Open repo within vscode.  Vscode should recognize that a `.devcontainer/` is present in this project and a small dialog should pop up in the lower left right corner asking if you want to `Reopen in Container` - select that options.  If you do not see this option to re-open in a container click the bottom left corner of vscode on the green box.  This should open a pop up menu allowing to select the choice of `Reopen in Container`.

3. Start the virtual enviornment.

        pipenv shell
