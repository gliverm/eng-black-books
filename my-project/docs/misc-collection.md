# Miscellaneous

A collection of miscellaneous stuff that belongs no where else.

## Statements that stuck out to me

* Be curious, not judgemental
* Success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm ( not sure I totally agree with this one )
* Power - taking your intention to reality and sustaining it
* The longer the time between writing code adn writing the tests, the more inefficient your automation will be.
* When you are dead and you don't know you are dead it is difficult only for others.  It is the same when you are stupid.
* Automation just gives us the ability to not only fail but fail at scale.
